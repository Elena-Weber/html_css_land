This is simple one-page website (landing webpage) built using advanced Flexbox and SCSS.

Please note the trip planner "Travel Buddy" is completely made-up by me. If such an app really exists, it is a pure coincidence.

You can see the website in the browser here:

I created this app based on lessons by Jonas Schmedtmann from Udemy.



PS

To start editing SCSS, type in terminal to see immediate changes:

npm run compile:sass
