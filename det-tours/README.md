This is simple one-page website (landing webpage) built using advanced SCSS and animation.

Please note the travel agency "Det-Tours" is completely made-up by me. If such an agency really exists, it is a pure coincidence.

You can see the website in the browser here:

https://brave-gates-9f5981.netlify.app/det-tours/index.html

I created this app based on lessons by Jonas Schmedtmann from Udemy.



PS

To start editing SCSS, type in terminal to see immediate changes:

npm run compile:sass
